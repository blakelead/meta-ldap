This Vagrant configuration shows how to use the the meta-ldap server to combine two or more ldap servers
(some of which could be WindowADs) into a single setup.

It creates an environment with the following servers:

- ldap1: an Openldap server using olc configuration, dc=backend1,dc=example
- ldap2: an Openldap server using olc configuration, dc=backend2,dc=example
- ldapmeta: a meta-ldap implementation of Openldap, to proxy both ldap1 and ldap2
- ldapclient: a basic Linux server configured to use ldapmeta as its OpenLDAP server, to demonstrate how you
    login using accounts proxied by ldapmeta

The architecture is illustrated below

ldap1 --\
         >---ldapmeta---ldapclient
ldap2---/

To install the environment, run the following:
vagrant up 

To verify that ldapclient can access both accounts on the 2 proxied OpenLDAP servers, run 
$ sh test.sh

This should display both b1user1 and b2user1 UIDs, indicating that ldapclient is retrieving content
from both OpenLDAP servers (ldap1 and ldap2)


== Connecting to a WindowsAD Server

The /etc/openldap/slapd-frontend.conf contains an entry for connecting to a Windows AD server. You
need to update this entry to reflect your current WindowsAD (domain, readonly account and password
for non-anonymous access) for it to work correctly. For license reasons there is no WindowsAD server 
provided as part of this Vagrant setup.
